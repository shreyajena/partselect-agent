        "text": "Always scrape your dishes prior to loading them in the machine, but there is no need to fully rinse. The detergent for a dishwasher actually needs some food particles to bind to in order to clean efficiently. If your plates are thoroughly rinsed beforehand, the enzymes in the detergent will break down the surfaces of your dishes instead. This can lead to your dishes looking scratched or cloudy over time. Run the hot water at your kitchen sink to \u201cprime\u201d the lines. This will let the machine spend less time and energy to heat the water up to an appropriate temperature to clean your dishes. Always place the detergent pod in the dispenser, don't just throw it into the wash tub. The dispenser releases the pod at the appropriate time in the washer cycle. If you throw it in the bottom of the machine, it will dissolve in the rinse cycle and be down the drain before the detergent even touches your dishes."

        "heading": "Reasons to Reset a Bosch Dishwasher",
        "text": "If your dishwasher will not start a cycle, the first thing you should try is a reset. A dishwasher not starting can be due to any number of things, from control board issues to power supply problems. Resetting the appliance will clear temporary problems and return the dishwasher to a normal operating state, while often keeping your saved settings intact. There are a number of minor issues that can be easily resolved with a reset, some of which we outline in this section. General Performance Issues: Through regular use and normal aging sometimes performance issues can pop-up, this is especially true of the electronics within a dishwasher. Resetting your Bosch Dishwasher before jumping to conclusions or taking anything apart will usually help resolve any minor issues. A glitch does not need to be made into a bigger problem. We always recommend starting with a reset and then running a test cycle to see if the issue persists. Error Code: If you notice an error code on your Bosch dishwasher, you can clear it with a reset and run another cycle to see if it reappears. If the code returns, it\u2019s a sign that the issue is not just a glitch and needs further investigation. After troubleshooting and performing any necessary repairs or part replacements, you\u2019ll need to clear the error code again to resume normal operation. This can be done with a simple reset of your Bosch dishwasher. Power Surge or Supply Issues: If there was a power surge, your home lost power, the dishwasher tripped or overloaded the breaker, or any other power related issue occurred, you may need a reset. Whether this happened when the dishwasher was in use or not it can cause issues, most of which would be resolved by resetting the machine. If it was in operation and it caused the dishwasher to stop mid-cycle you may notice standing water in the machine, when you reset the Bosch Dishwasher the appliance will activate the pump and drain the water. When the reset is complete you can start a new cycle to wash the dishes properly. Dishwasher Stuck on Cycle: If the dishwasher is stuck on a particular phase of the cycle, like draining or drying, the cycle will not advance. This could just be a glitch, and a reset will force it to quit and drain. You will then need to run another cycle to wash your dishes properly. Will Not Start: Sometimes your dishwasher will not receive the signals it requires to operate. If your Bosch Dishwasher cannot sense that the door is closed it will not run. There might not be an issue with the door closing, but there could be an issue with a sensor or how that information is communicated to the control board. More often than not, resetting the dishwasher will resolve this. Control Panel Issues: The control panel is the brain behind the operation, communicating and running the functions of the dishwasher. Common signs there are control panel issues are when the buttons stop responding to inputs, incorrect cycles are running, there are no lights or sounds coming from the panel, or if the lights are flashing. If you notice any odd behavior from your dishwasher when trying to use the buttons on the control panel you should reset the appliance. Display Issues: This could be related to control panel issues. Anytime you notice that the screen is unresponsive, blank, flashing, or displaying anything unusual or unexpected you can reset the dishwasher to resolve. Network Connection Issues: Smart features like Wi-Fi connectivity and the Home Connect app make your Bosch dishwasher more convenient, but they can occasionally run into connection problems. If your dishwasher is not staying connected to Wi-Fi or the Home Connect app, start by resetting the wireless connection on your router. If this does not resolve the problem, try resetting the internet connection directly from the appliance. If issues persist, the problem may lie within your home network. In some cases, security software, such as a router firewall, can block the appliance and may need to be adjusted. Cancel a Cycle: Whether you started the wrong cycle, or ran your dishwasher at the wrong time, sometimes you need to stop it after the cycle has started. Resetting the Bosch dishwasher will stop the current cycle and drain any water inside the appliance."

A soft reset is a built-in feature that cancels the current cycle, drains the machine, and restarts the control panel without cutting power or erasing your settings. Unlike unplugging the appliance, which takes longer and may erase your preferences, a soft reset refreshes the system, clears minor glitches or cycle errors, and gives your dishwasher a clean slate without extra hassle."

Some models will zero out the display or show \"0:01\" Close the dishwasher door. You will hear the drain pump engage, this is a sign the machine is resetting itself. The draining will take about a minute. Once the pump has stopped, and the display goes back to its initial state, the reset is complete. On some models, the dishwasher will beep or turn off to indicate the reset is finished. At this point you can start a new cycle to test the dishwasher. Note: The button you will use to reset most Bosch dishwasher models is the \"start\" button. Some older models designate specific buttons, like the \"Power\" button or \"Cancel\" button for the reset function, if so, it should be clearly labeled below the button. If you do not see this feature, and the start button does not work you may need to look up the instructions for your exact model number, there may be a combination of buttons you need to press and hold, for example \"Start\" + \"Cancel\" at the same time. The hope is that a soft reset will drain your appliance and get the dishwasher working again. If the soft reset doesn\u2019t work for your Bosch dishwasher, or the appliance won\u2019t reset at all, you can take it a step further and perform a hard reset."

At home, a common way to fix technical issues is simply unplugging a device and plugging it back in. With a dishwasher, however, unplugging it can be tedious since it often requires uninstalling the unit. For this reason, we recommend using your circuit breaker instead, which is much easier and just as effective. However, when using this method, be sure to exercise caution. Always check which other appliances share the same electrical circuit to avoid accidentally disrupting their operation or causing potential hazards."

Once that time has elapsed, flip the circuit breaker back on and wait for the dishwasher to boot up. When the power is fully resorted and the dishwasher is in its resting state, you will want to start a cycle to test that everything runs smoothly. The advancements in technology for our household appliances mean that we sometimes experience minor problems or glitches that cause performance issues, Bosch dishwashers are no exception. The first line of defense when you run into issues should be a reset. Whether your dishwasher won't run, the buttons won't work, or you are getting unexpected error codes, a simple reset will save you a lot of worry and time. If you have performed a reset and the dishwasher still won't run, or if the same issue keeps occurring, this indicates an underlying problem that needs investigation. You should stop using the dishwasher until you troubleshoot and identify the cause. If the appliance is displaying an error code, consult the user manual to determine what it means. We also offer additional dishwasher repair guides to help you through the process, as well as the OEM Bosch dishwasher parts you may need to get your appliance running again."

        "text": "Over time, food particles, grease, and soap scum can accumulate inside the tub, leading to a smelly dishwasher, reduced cleaning efficiency, and potentially harmful bacteria growth. It is best to perform a tub cleaning every month to help prevent these issues and ensure that your dishwasher effectively cleans your dishes. You can purchase a commercial cleaner and follow the manufacturer's instructions to clean your dishwasher tub, or you can make your own cleaner using vinegar and baking soda. Vinegar is acidic, which helps dissolve limescale and mineral deposits that can build up inside the dishwasher over time, especially if you have hard water. Baking soda acts as a gentle abrasive and helps in removing stubborn stains and residue. Both vinegar and baking soda also neutralize unpleasant dishwasher smells which makes them a popular choice for many household owners. Disconnect the dishwasher from the power supply and ensure there are no dishes or utensils inside the dishwasher. Pour about one cup of white vinegar into a dishwasher-safe cup or bowl. Place the cup or bowl filled with vinegar on the top rack of the dishwasher. This ensures that the vinegar is evenly distributed throughout the dishwasher during the cleaning cycle. Close the dishwasher door and select a regular wash cycle or a hot water cycle, depending on your dishwasher\u2019s settings. Start the dishwasher and let it run through the entire cycle. The hot water, combined with the vinegar, will help break down any grease, grime, and tough stains. Once the cycle is complete, open the dishwasher and let it cool down for a few minutes. Inspect the interior of the dishwasher. If there are any remaining spots or residue, use a cloth or sponge to wipe them down. You can also use a soft brush or toothbrush for hard-to-reach spots. After the vinegar cycle, sprinkle a cup of baking soda on the bottom of the dishwasher. This will help neutralize odors and further clean the interior. Run a short hot water cycle. After the baking soda cycle is complete, open the dishwasher and let it cool down for a few minutes. You can leave the door slightly ajar to allow fresh air to circulate through."

A clogged filter will also cause dirty water to be recirculated in the washer, resulting in poor cleaning results. Regularly cleaning the filter helps prevent buildup, ensures proper drainage, and maintains the dishwasher's efficiency, resulting in clean dishes with each wash cycle. It is recommended to clean the filter every 1- 3 months for best results. If your filter is no longer in good working condition, you will need to find a replacement dishwasher filter to keep your dishwasher running efficiently. Turn off the dishwasher and disconnect it from the water supply. Open the dishwasher door and pull out the lower rack and spray arm. You can find the filter at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. Carefully twist the filter out of the mounting bracket to clean it. Rinse the filter under warm running water to get rid of any food debris and residue. Use a soft brush and dish soap to scrub the filter clean. Avoid harsh cleaners as these may damage the filter.

        "text": "Whenever you run a washing cycle on your dishwasher, all of the water that eventually makes its way into the drain pump and hose has to pass through a filter. Every dishwasher has a filter, some even have two, but their location and type will depend on your specific model. A lot of filters in newer models are designed to be removed for easier cleaning, and quickly checking your appliance should make the filter easy to find. The filter is an essential part of your dishwasher and single-handedly stops any food particles, food debris, or other objects from entering and damaging the pump. This is why cleaning and maintaining the filter in your dishwasher is so important, it can save you from costly repairs and even extend the life of your dishwasher. If the filter in your dishwasher is working effectively it is preventing clogs, leaks, and damage to the drain hose and drain pump. The filter works to protect more vital and expensive parts in your dishwasher, and it means you don't need to worry about pre-rinsing and cleaning your dishes before you load them into the dishwasher. This is why we highly recommend you make cleaning and inspecting the filter in your Whirlpool dishwasher a priority; it is a simple task, and taking care of this part pays off."

Do not use a wire brush or scouring pad (also known as a hard sponge), because they may damage the filter. Open the dishwasher door and remove the lower dish rack. Locate the filters at the bottom of the dishwasher. Some models may only have one, but many have two; an upper filter and a lower one. Rotate the upper filter assembly a quarter-turn counterclockwise, and lift it out to remove it. With the upper filter out, pull on the lower filter where the upper filter was, then lift it up and pull it out. Run both filters under warm water until all food particles are gone. Any harder to remove particles or calcium deposits may require the use of a small bristle brush to clean off. Once both filters are cleaned, put the lower filter in first by placing each side under their respective locating tabs, and ensure the circular hole in the filter is lined up with the round opening underneath. Insert the upper filter in the opening of the lower filter, and slowly rotate it clockwise until it drops. Once it drops, rotate it clockwise again until it locks in place. If you notice an arrow on the filter, it does not need to be lined up with anything, Just make sure the filter is locked in place and cannot freely rotate."

This leads to further clogs and eventually too much water sitting in the dishwasher tub, which will raise the float switch and lead to a blinking 'Heavy' light. But we're here to explain exactly how to inspect your filter and either clean or replace it, so your dishwasher can properly drain. Open your dishwasher door and locate the filter, usually at the bottom of the tub's interior. Remove the lower dish rack, and if necessary, remove the lower spray arm to gain access to the filter. Remove the filter and, if necessary, clean it by soaking it in warm soap and water for 5 minutes, and then scrubbing it with a soft-bristle brush. Inspect the filter for any signs of damage, and if you notice any holes or other damage that would otherwise stop it from working properly, replace it with a new filter.

The drain hose, as its name implies, is a plastic hose attached to your dishwasher's drain pump that allows dirty and food-debris-filled water to exit the dishwasher and be disposed of. If this drain hose is clogged or cracked, it will cause water to either build up inside the dishwasher because it can't exit, or cause water to leak in and around your dishwasher, This leads to the float switch detecting too much water, and a flashing 'Heavy' light. To explain how to find your drain hose and see if it's in need of a replacement, check out the guide below! Locate the drain hose either behind the dishwasher or below it, or by inspecting underneath your sink. Run a short cycle on your dishwasher and monitor the drain hose for any water flow stoppages. If you notice the water stopping and/or not flowing consistently, disconnect your dishwasher from the wall outlet after the cycle is over. If your drain hose is clogged, use a screwdriver or wrench to remove any clamps and gain access to the hose's connection point, and use paper towel or a tube brush to dislodge and remove the clog. If your drain hose is also connected to a garbage disposal system, ensure it's turned off before you open it and inspect its interior for any clogs. If you discover your drain hose is not clogged but is instead cracked or broken, it will need to be replaced. Once your dishwasher's drain hose has been cleaned or replaced, run a short cycle to see if it drains properly."

The drain pump is what facilitates the draining of the dishwasher, and in some models can be the main motor for the filling and draining of all water. If the drain pump is clogged or bad, it will cause water not to drain and instead buildup inside the dishwasher tub, and lead to the float switch detecting too much water, and cause the 'Heavy' light to start blinking. Whether there's something lodged in the drain pump or if there's a broken seal, we've got the guide to explain to you precisely how to figure out what's going on in your dishwasher. Disconnect your dishwasher from the wall outlet and turn off its water supply. Use a screwdriver or drill to unthread and remove the kickplate at the bottom of the dishwasher. Carefully unthread the fill hose from the inlet valve, and disconnect the electrical junction box and drain hose. Pull the dishwasher out, and flip it on its back by pulling and pushing its top backwards or to the side. Tip: Keep a towel close by for any water spilling that may occur. Unthread and remove any plastic panels covering the bottom of the dishwasher, as well as the leak detector sensor wire. Remove the wire harness from the drain pump's terminals, and rotate the drain pump counter clockwise while pulling it towards you to remove it. Inspect the drain pump for any clogs or damage, and remove any pieces of debris that could be causing the pump not to drain. If there's nothing stuck or lodged in the pump, ensure you've checked the drain hose and other drain system parts. Use a multimeter to test the pump for defects or failures. If it doesn't read nearly zero with both probes touching the terminals, or one terminal touching ground, the pump likely failed. Install the proper wires to the drain pump, and then install the drain pump into the dishwasher by rotating it clockwise and pushing on it. Replace the leak detector sensor, as well as the plastic cover panels if applicable, then flip the dishwasher back upright. Push the dishwasher back into place, and reinstall the fill hose, drain hose, and electrical junction box.

Any issues with the inlet valve caused by electrical failure or a plugged screen will result in water underneath your dishwasher and a detection by the leak sensor, and a blinking 'Heavy' light. The easiest way to resolve this is by removing the inlet valve and checking for any issues with it, and either fixing or replacing it, which we'll explain how to do.

The issue being that if the float switch is bad, water will continue to fill into the dishwasher and eventually leak out of your dishwasher, and cause the leak sensor to detect it, which is where you see the 'Heavy' light blinking. So if you're curious whether this part is working properly, read on! Disconnect power to your dishwasher. Locate the float switch in your dishwasher at the bottom of the appliance, underneath the spray arm, which will appear as a small round component. To gain access to the float switch, you will need to remove the spray arm, dish racks, and unthread and remove certain panels within your dishwasher. Once you've gained access to the switch, carefully remove it and disconnect any wires connected to it. Use a multimeter to test the switch for continuity, and replace it if it's bad or defective. With the new or existing switch, install it into place in your dishwasher and secure whichever panels were originally removed, as well as the spray arm and dish racks. Run a few cycles in your dishwasher and monitor for leak detections or other issues. At this point, your Samsung dishwasher should be revived from its unstable condition, and you've got it back to cleaning!

You can use Power Cool in the following scenarios to help get the most out of your appliance: After Grocery Shopping: You can use Power Cool to quickly chill newly purchased perishables, ensuring they remain fresh for longer periods. This is great for items such as fruits and vegetables which tend to go bad faster than other food items. Preparing for Gatherings: When you are expecting guests or hosting a party, you can activate Power Cool to rapidly chill beverages. This allows you and your guests to enjoy refreshments without any delay. Emergency Thawing: In the event of unexpected thawing or partially melted frozen items, such as due to a power outage or a fault in the fridge, you can activate the Power Cool to quickly restore the optimal temperature inside the fridge and preserve food quality. This means you can save money and avoid throwing out your food. Hot Weather Conditions: During the hot summer months, the Power Cool feature is a great way to combat temperature fluctuations and maintain consistent cooling performance in order to protect your food from spoiling. Post-Cooking: After cooking a large meal, you can use Power Cool to quickly cool down leftovers before storing them in the refrigerator, preventing bacterial growth and maintaining food safety. Note that you should avoid placing very hot items in the fridge as hot items will release steam which condenses on the shelves and walls of the fridge. This creates a humid environment which can promote bacterial growth and increase food spoilage. Refrigerator Overload: When the refrigerator is overloaded with items, enabling Power Cool allows cold air to circulate through the fridge faster which ensures efficient cooling throughout the appliance. However, it is important to note that the fridge will need to use significant energy to run Power Cool when it is overloaded."

        "heading": "Factors that Affect Duration of Power Cool",
        "text": "The duration of the Power Cool feature can be influenced by several factors: Initial Temperature: The starting temperature inside the refrigerator affects how long the Power Cool feature will need to run to reach 1\u00b0C. If the fridge is already low, Power Cool might not need to run for as long. Amount and Temperature of Contents: The more and warmer the items you've just placed in the fridge, the longer Power Cool may need to run to bring the overall temperature down. If you've just done a large grocery shopping trip and filled the fridge with items then, Power Cool will need more time to chill all the items. Average Room Temperature: The temperature of the kitchen can impact how quickly the fridge can cool down. If the room temperature is warmer, the fridge will have to work harder to cool down. This is especially true in the summer months when average temperatures are higher. Refrigerator Age: As the refrigerator ages, parts such as the compressor, condenser coils, and seals may wear down, leading to reduced cooling efficiency and increased energy consumption. In such cases, the Power Cool feature will still work as intended, but it might take longer to achieve the desired temperature or require more energy to operate. If you have noticed that your fridge is not running efficiently, it may be due for some maintenance. Frequency of Door Openings: Opening the refrigerator door frequently during the Power Cool cycle allows warm air to enter the fridge compartment which can increase the amount of the refrigerator needs to cool down. Size of the Refrigerator: Larger refrigerators with more internal volume may require longer Power Cool cycles to reach the desired temperature compared to smaller models."

You can also utilize PVC glue which is a transparent sealant with a shorter drying time than other glues. It is important to note that using sealants to fix tears in your door seal is a temporary measure and it is best to replace the door seal as a more permanent solution. Clean the torn area of the fridge door seal and ensure the cleaned area is completely dry before beginning. Cut a piece of wax paper that is slightly larger than the torn area of the seal. Squeeze a small amount of silicone glue onto the torn area of the seal and spread it evenly over the tear. Carefully place the wax paper over the silicone glue and press it gently into place. Use your fingers to smooth out any air bubbles or wrinkles in the wax paper and ensure that it is lying flat over the sealant. Let the silicone sealant cure according to the manufacturer's instructions. This typically takes several hours. Once the silicone sealant is fully cured, carefully peel away the wax paper from the repaired area. Check the repaired area to ensure that the silicone sealant has formed a strong bond and sealed the tear effectively. Close the refrigerator door and check that the repaired seal creates an airtight seal."

        "heading": "Why is My Refrigerator Tripping the Breaker?",
        "text": "The simplest and most common reason a refrigerator, or any appliance, would trip a circuit breaker or fuse box is because it's overloading the overall circuit. Overloading a circuit or fuse means that one appliance or device is drawing too much power it at one given time, compared to the rated capacity of the circuit or fuse. Normally when wiring homes, refrigerators are put on their own designated outlet due to the amount of power they pull, in an effort to curb this from happening. Manufacturers even state that a refrigerator must be on its own independent household circuit, so no other appliance or electrical device should be on the same circuit. But there are other reasons why a circuit trips, such as faulty wiring from the outlet itself or the refrigerator connected to it, or if an older model refrigerator simply loses its power efficiency over time."

        "heading": "Inspect the Wall Outlet",
        "text": "The first place to inspect if you suspect your refrigerator is tripping your circuit breaker is the wall outlet. To do this, you will need a voltage tester/multimeter that can display the output of the power at the outlet itself. That way you can find out if the outlet is outputting the proper voltage for the fridge and any other appliances that may be connected. When doing this, you should start by looking for visual indications of a problem, specifically signs of arcing or burning around the outlet, because those are clear indications of an issue with the outlet and the power cord of your refrigerator. A worn or defective outlet can cause electricity to arc and potentially burn the outlet, and if there are any damaged or exposed wires on the power cord, the outlet can cause issues with it, too. The power cord for your refrigerator can be replaced if it is found to be the cause of the refrigerators issue. Wall outlets are designed to grip the prongs of the cord, and if the prongs are worn or damaged, that grip is lost. If the connection is loose, eventually it will melt the cord and any other plastic (i.e. the outlet cover) in the process. If the connection is poor enough between the prongs and the outlet, electricity will jump the gap and create a spark or arc, which burns even more and accelerates the failure. Test the voltage coming out of the outlet with a voltage tester to ensure you have the proper level between 110-120V. A low voltage will make starting the motor more difficult and could trop a breaker or fuse. If the power cord is severely damaged and wires are exposed, it'll need to be replaced as soon as possible with an OEM cord. To do this, you will need work gloves, and a set of pliers. All you need to do is unplug your fridge and pull it out from the wall until you can access it, then unscrew any cover on the rear of the appliance. Follow the cord to where it connects and remove the clamp securing it. Connect the new one and reinstall the clamp, as well as the rear cover of the fridge, before you plug it back in."

        "heading": "Troubleshoot Power Issues With Your Refrigerator",
        "text": "If you don't see any issues with your outlet or the surrounding area, it's time to test your refrigerator to see whether the tripping problem is being caused by the appliance. We recommend  testing the defrost timer and run capacitor in your refrigerator as your next steps, because it they are more likely to be causing the problem, than the breaker or fuse in your home. It makes sense to test and rule these out before exploring more serious electrical inspections. To troubleshoot your refrigerator, you will need a clamp multimeter and a line splitting tool to test the current within its power cord. First, you will want to move your refrigerator to a different outlet. This can be an outlet nearby,  just as long as your refrigerator is on a different circuit. However, you can also plug your fridge into an extension cord instead of moving it, but the cord needs to be properly rated for 15 or 20A. Ensure your refrigerator is plugged in directly to the line splitting tool and turned on. Plug the line splitting tool into your home's outlet and set your clamp on multimeter, capable of reading household currents, up with the refrigerator's power cord. A line splitting tool is a device that separates hot from neutral and ground wires, so you can measure the current being drawn. Set all temperature settings in the fridge to their lowest (coldest); this is to ensure it does not turn off during testing. Using the clamp multimeter, check the current (amperage) being used by the fridge. If the current being used by the fridge exceeds 15A, the electrical problem lies within the refrigerator. If the current is less than 15A, put your refrigerator into defrosting mode. Models with timers can be advanced to initiate a defrost, whereas electronic control boards will require a specific set of steps to initiate a defrost cycle for testing. Since these steps can vary by make and manufacturer, you will need to find this information in your owner's manual or online. Check the current reading again with your multimeter and if it exceeds 15A, the problem is with the fridge. If after you've tested the fridge, the current does not exceed 15A, the circuitry issue is with your home. This could be an issue with a weak break, or a worn fuse holder, if your home has screw-in fuses."

They're also two of the most common reasons for a fridge to experience a short or interrupted circuit, due to the heater or timer/control board failing and pulling too much power, and overloading and tripping the outlet. Continue reading to find out how to replace or test your defrost timer or heater! Unplug your refrigerator from its wall outlet. Open your freezer compartment and locate the heater. It's usually behind the back panel of the freezer section. Anything in the way will need to be removed, like the food items and contents of your freezer, and parts like the ice maker, and then finally the cover panel. This will all depend on your model and the features it includes. Use a screwdriver to unthread any securing screws or clips, and then remove the cover. Use a set of pliers to disconnect the wires for the heater. Using a multimeter, set it to RX1 and place a lead on each of the terminals. If the reading is zero or infinity, replace it. If not, reinstall it and test your defrost timer instead. If your defrost heater was the issue, remove the old one and replace it with the new one, and then carefully reassemble your freezer compartment. Then plug your fridge back in and monitor it. If the defrost heater is not the issue, you will need to inspect and potentially replace the defrost timer or control board, depending on your refrigerator model. If your model has a control board instead of a timer, you will need to test the relay board. A relay board will either be built into the back of the fridge (and can only be accessed by pulling the fridge out from the wall) or will be in the same place as the control board. To find the timer or control board in your fridge you will need to locate the control panel, since these parts are attached to the control panel. Depending on the model, it'll be in a number of places. The most common location for control panels would be in the back of the appliance near the top, or on the ceiling of the fridge compartment, behind the kick plate at the bottom of your fridge, or down by the compressor at the rear of the fridge. Use a screwdriver to unthread the control panel and open it. Disconnect the wire harness of the control panel to the fridge. Use a screwdriver to disconnect the defrost timer and heater from its assembly. Whether you have a timer or control board, testing it for continuity is the same. Using a multimeter, set it to the X1 setting for Ohm's and connect a probe to each terminal. If there is no continuity, replace the timer immediately. Install the new timer and any wires connected to it. Connect the control panel's wire harness to the fridge and rethread the securing screws. Plug your fridge back in and monitor it. Note : To ensure that your relay or control board is bad/faulty, have them diagnosed by a qualified technician before purchasing a new one to replace it."

But if the capacitor fails from old age or an electrical surge, it will no longer operate properly and it will overload its outlet, which leads to a short and tripped circuit. If you listen carefully, a failed capacitor will cause the compressor to click when it overloads the circuit. The capacitor will be located at the bottom rear portion of the refrigerator, and can be tested and replaced easily with a set of pliers, screwdriver, wrench, multimeter, and work gloves. Read along and we'll explain exactly how to fix your compressor. Unplug your refrigerator from the wall outlet. Pull your fridge out from the wall, and remove its back panel with a screwdriver or wrench. Locate the capacitor and discharge any potentially stored electricity from it. This can be done by putting a metal object, like a screwdriver, across the two terminals of the capacitor. Remove any harnesses connected to it with a set of pliers. Carefully remove the old capacitor. Use a multimeter in Ohms mode to test it for continuity by touching the probes to the terminals. Ideally the resistance will rise and then fall back to zero, but if it rises and stays, the capacitor is shorted. If it does not rise at all, it is open and needs to be replaced. To replace it, simply install the new capacitor in the old one's place, and reinstall the wiring harnesses by plugging them onto the capacitor. Replace the back panel of the fridge, and plug it back in. Let it run for a few minutes and take note of anything that happens."

        "text": "Replacing a refrigerator shelf is not always as simple as just removing it and inserting the new one. With some refrigerator makes, models, and types, there may be screws that need to be unthreaded, or clips and clamps that need to be pushed in to ultimately be able to remove the shelf in question. And if you're worried about finding the right shelf , drawer and glides ,  or rack for your refrigerator \u2013 there's no need! All of the parts you need for your fridge can be found at PartSelect.com! Identify the shelf that needs to be replaced. This shelf may be made of plastic, glass, metal, etc. Locate any securing fasteners for the shelf and carefully remove them. These fasteners may be clamps that need to be untwisted, screws which would need a screwdriver to unthread, or a groove that you simply slide out of. If you're removing a drawer, such as a crisper, remove the drawer first, then the glides (if both need replacing). If the shelf you're replacing is made entirely of glass, be sure to inspect the shelf structure carefully. Some fridge models require you to remove the entire housing, whereas other glass shelves can be lifted and removed easily. Carefully lift or remove the shelf out of its slot. Once the old shelf is removed, insert the new shelf carefully as well, as to not damage it or the fridge's interior. If necessary, secure the new shelf within its housing and/or with the appropriate mechanism."

        "heading": "Replacing a Glass Refrigerator Shelf Insert",
        "text": "When replacing a glass shelf insert within your fridge, handle it with care to avoid cracking or shattering it. Most refrigerator models with glass shelf panes will be made of tempered glass, so when removing it, whether to insert a new one or to clean it, allow it to return to room temperature before spraying it with water or cleaning spray. Otherwise, it will likely shatter and could potentially harm you and anyone around. You can replace a tempered glass shelf with an acrylic or strong plastic material, however, a material such as Corian is much more suitable as it's hypo-allergenic, easier to clean, and does not shatter. Be sure not to overload the glass itself, as tempered glass can normally only sustain around 35 lbs of force per square foot. To replace a glass pane shelf insert, simply lift it out of its position and pull it out. If your refrigerator's shelf frame has retaining clips, be sure to remove the frame as well, and undo the clips for the old glass pane before installing the new one. Then lay the new shelf where the old one was, and you're good to go!"

        "heading": "Replacing a Glass Shelf with a Metal Frame",
        "text": "Replacing a glass refrigerator shelf with a metal frame likely means that the glass or the frame is broken or cracked, and not able to support any food items on top or in a drawer below. In this case, it's almost impossible to repair, so replacing the shelf outright is normally the only option. It's important to remember that when removing a shelf with a glass pane to clean that you allow the shelf to warm to room temperature before spraying it with water or cleaner."

        "text": "The replacement process for a refrigerator door shelf is quite simple but does require instruction, depending on the type of securing mechanism. Some door shelves lift up and out, whereas some need to be pulled out directly from the door, and others have a clip or clamp securing them into the door. In any case, when replacing these shelves, it's important to install them carefully to avoid accidentally chipping, cracking, or bending the plastic or metal of the shelf itself."

        "heading": "What Do the tF and tC Codes Mean on GE Refrigerators?",
        "text": "The tF and tC codes on GE refrigerators are display codes for two special settings called TurboFreeze and TurboCool. When activated, these settings rapidly adjust the temperature in different compartments of the refrigerator to address particular cooling needs. But, many people think these codes mean something is wrong and try to fix them, even though they don't indicate any issues with the fridge. It's a common mistake that can cause confusion and unnecessary repairs."

        "heading": "What is the TurboFreeze (tF) Mode on GE Refrigerators?",
        "text": "TurboFreeze is a mode meant to quickly make the freezer colder. When you see the tF code, it means this feature is turned on. It's perfect for scenarios when you're opening the freezer door frequently or for extended periods, like when you're rearranging or cleaning it, hosting a large gathering, or need to rapidly cool down items, such as a bottle of wine or newly purchased groceries. The symbol for TurboFreeze might resemble 'EF,' an upside-down 'f' with an 'F,' or something similar. Just keep in mind that TurboFreeze won't make your ice maker work faster."

        "heading": "What is the TurboCool (tC) Mode on GE Refrigerators?",
        "text": "This setting is for the refrigerator section, and when you see the tC code, it means this feature is active. It quickly lowers the temperature inside the fridge, which is handy when you've been opening the fridge door frequently, adding a lot of new food to the fridge (like after a big grocery shopping trip, storing a big batch of meals, or putting away warm leftovers). TurboCool is also helpful when your fridge experiences a power outage, as it helps bring the temperature back to normal quickly. You might spot a symbol like EC, an upside-down \u2018f\u2019 with a \u2018C\u2019 instead."

        "heading": "How Do the tF and tC Settings Work on GE Refrigerators?",
        "text": "The TurboFreeze and TurboCool settings on GE refrigerators focus on two main components: the compressor and the fans. When you turn on either of these settings, the compressor speeds up, and the fans start moving cold air more vigorously. This rapid action swiftly cools down the specific compartments: the tC setting targets the fresh food section, while the tF setting chills the freezer. As this happens, you'll see 'tF' or 'tC' on the display. You can even use these settings together at the same time for the most efficient cooling."

        "heading": "How to Use the tF Setting",
        "text": "To activate or deactivate TurboFreeze, press and hold the Freezer button for 3 seconds. On touch screen (LCD) models, select Express Mode instead. The TurboFreeze setting will run for 8 hours by default, but you can manually turn it off if needed."
      },
      {
        "heading": "How to Use the tC Setting",
        "text": "To turn on or off TurboCool, follow a similar process: press and hold the Fridge button for 3 seconds. For touch screen (LCD) models, use the Express Mode button. TurboCool will automatically turn off after 2 hours, but you can turn it off manually by pressing and holding the Turbo Cool button for 3 seconds. If you find that the tF or tC settings aren't working as expected, first, check for any power issues or control lock settings. If the temperature doesn't adjust properly, make sure there's no excessive frost buildup or blocked air vents. Regular maintenance is crucial to ensure these features work effectively, which includes cleaning the condenser coils and ensuring the door seals are intact."

        "heading": "Considerations to Using the tF and tC Settings on GE Refrigerators",
        "text": "Now that you understand how to use the tF and tC settings effectively, it's essential to understand some key considerations when using them. These will help you make the most of these features while ensuring your refrigerator runs efficiently and your food stays in excellent condition. Noise Level: These settings may make your refrigerator run a bit louder than usual because the compressor and fans work harder. If noise is a concern, especially during quiet times, consider using these settings when they are less disruptive. Duration of Settings: Remember to turn off the settings when they are no longer needed, as they use more energy. Energy Costs: Frequent use of tF and tC settings can lead to higher energy bills over time. Be mindful of your energy usage and use these features judicially to balance convenience and cost. Usage Limitations: These features are designed for temporary use. Using them continuously can lead to increased energy consumption, overcooling (which may cause frost on food and wilting of fruits and vegetables), and greater wear on the refrigerator\u2019s components. Effect on Other Foods: While tF and tC are great for cooling certain items quickly, they can accidentally freeze or over-chill other items in the fridge or freezer. Be mindful of where you place sensitive items like produce or liquids, as they can freeze or expand under these settings.
